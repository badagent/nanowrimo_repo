For encrypting and storing my novel

## What is this about?
This is about National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) which is every year in november.
As a software developer, I prefer to use git / github for storing my novel but I really don't like the idea of anybody reading the crap I wrote. ;-)

That's why I build myself some simple scripts to prepare my files and encrypt and decrypt my masterpiece. By setting .gitignore accordingly, I can only upload my encrpyted files as a branch or whatever.

Feel free to use my script although currently there is no documentation and no error handling in it.
